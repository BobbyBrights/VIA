                              <p>In May 2014, from the 13th through the 18th, VIA launched our inaugural FERUS FESTIVAL, which we have designated as our incubation time for new projects in a workshop perfor- mance setting. Each evening features an artist or many artists with whom we are honored to have had the chance to work with.</p>
                              <p>We are thrilled to have had Q2 Music as our Digital Partner. FERUS Festival was recorded for on-demand listening by our Digital Partner, Q2 Music, WQXRâ€™s online radio station for con- temporary classical music at q2music.org. For the full list of performances on-demand, visit their page featuring our festival.</p>

                              <p>Jeffrey Zeigler bringing together the wonderful musicians, Vijay Iyer, Scott Colley, and Satoshi Takeishi in a small debut at Ferus festival. This will be the first time that these musicians have ever shared the stage together in what will most assuredly be a gripping performance that will be an exploration of fresh possibilities and new sounds.</p>
